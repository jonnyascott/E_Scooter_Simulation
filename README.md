# Simulating e-scooter usage in cities

1. We create a basic model to simulate demand and journeys of e-scooters in cities
2. We empirically assess our model by animating and visualizing data generated by the model
3. We investigate quantitative questions arising in this setting, e.g. what is the optimal number of scooters in a city?
