# Simulating e-scooter usage in cities

1. We create a basic model to simulate demand and journeys of e-scooters in cities
2. We empirically assess our model by visualizing data generated by the model
3. We investigate quantitative questions arising in this setting, e.g. what is the optimal number of scooters in a city?

## The Model

- We simulate a city as an n x n grid with population at each grid point, pop(p) ~ Normal(f(d), g(d)) where d = dist(p, centre).
- We simulate demand as a Poisson random variable, at time (t), city location (p): N(t,p) ~ Poisson(c(t)h(pop(p)))
- We simulate a journey as direct path from a previously sampled start point to a destination. We sample destinations as 2d Gaussian random variables with mean city centre and covariance matrix scaled by city size

## Visualizations

We produce visualizations of journey data using both animations and heatmaps. To view an animation run file: cities.py (SPACE to start animation).

## Quantitative Analysis

We investigated the following questions

- What is the optimal number of scooters to place in a city?
- What is the optimal inital placing of scooters at the start of the day?

Both of these questions we address by introducing a costing model for scooter operations and empirically finding the optimal settings of parameters in the contexts of the above questions.
